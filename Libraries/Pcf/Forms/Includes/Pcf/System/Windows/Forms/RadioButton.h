        /// @remarks Set the AcceptButton or CancelButton property of a Form to allow users to click a button by pressing the ENTER or ESC keys even if the button does not have focus. This gives the form the behavior of a dialog box.
        /// @remarks When you display a form using the ShowDialog method, you can use the DialogResult property of a button to specify the return value of ShowDialog.
        /// @remarks You can change the button's appearance. For example, to make it appear flat for a Web look, set the FlatStyle property to FlatStyle.Flat. The FlatStyle property can also be set to FlatStyle.Popup, which appears flat until the mouse pointer passes over the button; then the button takes on the standard Windows button appearance.
