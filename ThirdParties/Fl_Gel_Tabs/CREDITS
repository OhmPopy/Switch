CORE DEVELOPERS

    Greg Ercolano     05/29/2005 - initial implementation 05/29/2005
    				   Fl_Gel_Tabs, geltabs-test, docs.

    'Bill Spitzak and others'; Core FLTK 'Fl_Tabs' authors, from which 
    this widget is highly derived, and would not otherwise be possible.

WIDGET'S IMAGE DESIGN
    
    With nods to Apple's Aqua, I never the less drew the gradient used
    in these widgets myself using Gimp, using some simple brush strokes,
    and a bit of pixel editing. NO, I DID NOT SCREEN GRAB APPLE'S BUTTONS.
    I purposefully drew the gradients myself to avoid any possible
    copyright infringement on Apple's own aqua designs.
