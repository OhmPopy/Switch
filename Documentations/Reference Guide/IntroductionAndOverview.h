/// The Pcf Libraries are...
///   * a collection of C++ classes libraries, similar in concept to the .NET Framework;
///   * focused on "internet-age" network-centric applications;
///   * written in efficient, modern ANSI/ISO Standard C++ and based on the C++ Standard Library/STL;
///   * and highly portable and available on many different platforms;

///  * Cache framework
///  * Date and Time classes
///  * Delegates for events (signal/slot mechanism) and notifications
///  * FTP client for transferring files
///  * Filesystem classes for platform-independent path manipulation, directory listing and globing
///  * HTTP server and client (also secure), C++ Server Page Compiler
///  * Logging
///  * Multithreading: basic threads and synchronization and advanced facilities (thread pool, active objects, work queues, etc.)
///  * Platform Abstraction: write once, compile and run on multiple platforms
///  * Processes and IPC
///  * Reactor framework
///  * SQL database access (SQLite)
///  * Smart pointers and memory management (buffer, pool)
///  * Sockets and raw sockets
///  * Stream classes for Base64 and HexBinary encoding/decoding, compression (zlib), line ending conversion, reading/writing to memory, etc.
///  * String formatting and string utilities
///  * TCP server framework (multithreaded)
///  * Text encodings and conversions
///  * Tuples
///  * URI handling
///  * UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 and Unicode support
///  * UUID handling and generation ￼￼

/// @section ObjectivesAndMissionSection Objectives and Mission
///  * Pcf is a powerful, yet easy to use platform to build your applications upon
///  * Pcf allows you to build highly portable applications (write once – compile and run anywhere)
///  * Pcf is modular and scalable from embedded applications
///  * Pcf provides consistent, comprehensive and comprehensible programming interfaces
///  * Pcf is written in fast, efficient C++
///  * Pcf favors simplicity over complexity ("as simple as possible, but not simpler")
///  * Pcf aims for consistency in design, coding style and documentation
///  * Pcf emphasizes source code quality, in terms of readability, comprehensiveness, consistency, style and testability
///  * Pcf aims to make C++ programming fun again Guiding Principles
///  * Strong focus on code quality, style, consistency and code readability –all code must satisfy our coding style guide
///  * Strong focus on tests (automated unit tests with high coverage)
///  * Build on top of solid foundations – use existing proven C libraries (e.g. libcurl, icu, zlib, SQLite) where it makes sense
