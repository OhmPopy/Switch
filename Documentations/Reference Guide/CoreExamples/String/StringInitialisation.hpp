/// @page StringInitialisationPage Create String
/// By assigning a String literal to a String variable. This is the most commonly used method for creating a String. The following example uses assignment to create several Strings. Note that in C++, because the backslash () is an escape character, literal backslashes in a String must be escaped.
/// @include String1.cpp
/// By calling a String class constructor. The following example instantiates Strings by calling several class constructors. Note that some of the constructors include pointers to character arrays or signed byte arrays as parameters.
/// @include String2.cpp
/// By using the String concatenation operator (+ in C++) to create a single String from any combination of String instances and String literals. The following example illustrates the use of the String concatenation operator.
/// @include String3.cpp
/// By retrieving a property or calling a method that returns a String. The following example uses the methods of the String class to extract a substring from a larger String.
/// @include String4.cpp
