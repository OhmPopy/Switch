/// @section ThePcfLibrariesAreSection The Pcf Libraries are...
///   * a collection of C++ classes libraries, similar to the .NET Framework;
///   * written in efficient, modern C++14;
///   * and highly portable and available on many different platforms;
///
/// @image HTML Pcf.png
///
/// @section Pcfiscomposedof4librariesSection Pcf is composed of 4 libraries
///   * <b>Pcf.Core</b> library is a library of classes, interfaces, and value types that provide access to system functionality. It is the foundation on which c++ applications, components, and controls are built.
///   * <b>Pcf.Drawing</b> library contains types that support basic GDI+ graphics functionality. Child namespaces support advanced two-dimensional and vector graphics functionality, advanced imaging functionality, and print-related and typographical services. A child namespace also contains types that extend design-time user-interface logic and drawing.
///   * <b>Pcf.Forms</b> library contains classes for creating Windows-based applications that take full advantage of the rich user interface features available in the Microsoft Windows operating system.
///   * <b>Pcf.TUnit</b> library contains unit testing framework.
///
/// @section ObjectivesAndMissionSection Objectives and Mission
///  * Pcf is a powerful, yet easy to use platform to build your applications upon
///  * Pcf allows you to build highly portable applications (write once – compile and run anywhere)
///  * Pcf is modular and scalable from embedded applications
///  * Pcf provides consistent, comprehensive and comprehensible programming interfaces
///  * Pcf is written in fast, efficient C++
///  * Pcf favors simplicity over complexity ("as simple as possible, but not simpler")
///  * Pcf aims for consistency in design, coding style and documentation
///  * Pcf emphasizes source code quality, in terms of readability, comprehensiveness, consistency, style and testability
///  * Pcf aims to make C++ programming fun again Guiding Principles
///  * Strong focus on code quality, style, consistency and code readability –all code must satisfy our coding style guide
///  * Strong focus on tests (automated unit tests with high coverage)
///  * Build on top of solid foundations – use existing proven C libraries (e.g. libcurl, icu, zlib, SQLite) where it makes sense
