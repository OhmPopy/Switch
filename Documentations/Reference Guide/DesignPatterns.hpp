/// @page CommonDesignPatternsPage Common Design Patterns
///
/// Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.
///
/// The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral (for a complete list see below).
///
/// To give you a head start, the Pcf C++ source code for each pattern is provided in structural form. Structural code uses type names as defined in the pattern definition and UML diagrams.

/// * @ref BuilderPage                Separates object construction from its representation
/// * @ref FactoryMethodPage	        Creates an instance of several derived classes
/// * @ref PrototypePage              A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
/// * @ref SingletonPage              A class of which only a single instance can exist
