/// @page TutorialsPage The Pcf Tutorials
///
/// The Pcf tutorials provide an overview of the basics of the language and identify important language features. Each tutorial includes one or more sample programs. The tutorials discuss the sample code plus provide additional background information. They also link to the corresponding sample abstract topics, where you can download and run the sample programs.

/// |---------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------|
/// | @ref TutorialHelloWorldPage                       | Shows a Hello World application. | Simple |
/// | @ref TutorialCommandLineParametersPage            | Shows simple command-line processing; also shows array indexing. | Simple |
/// | @ref TutorialNamespacesPage                       | Shows how to use namespaces. | Simple |
/// | @ref TutorialSmartPointerPage                     | Shows how to use smart pointer (Pcf::UniquePointer and Pcf::SharedPointer). | Simple |
/// | @ref TutorialArraysPage                           | Shows how to use arrays. | Simple |
/// | @ref TutorialPropertiesPage                       | Shows how properties are declared and used; also demonstrates abstract properties. | Simple |
/// | @ref TutorialCollectionClassesPage                | Shows how to make collection classes that can be used with foreach. | Intermediate |
/// | @ref TutorialIndexerPage                          | Shows how to use array notation to access an object. | Intermediate |
/// | @ref TutorialIndexedPropertiesPage                | Shows how to implement a class that uses indexed properties. Indexed properties allow you to use a class that represents an array-like collection of several different kinds of things. | Intermediate |
/// | @ref TutorialUserDefinedConversionsPage           | Shows how to define conversions to and from user-defined types. | Intermediate |
/// | @ref TutorialOperatorOverloadingPage              | Shows how user-defined classes can overload operators. | Intermediate |
/// | @ref TutorialDelegatesPage                        | Shows how delegates are declared, mapped, and combined. | Intermediate |
/// | @ref TutorialEventsPage                           | Shows how to use events in C++. | Intermediate |
/// | @ref TutorialExpliciteInterfaceImplementationPage | Demonstrates how to explicitly implement interface members. | Intermediate |
/// | @ref TutorialConditionalMethodPage                | Demonstrates conditional methods, which provide a powerful mechanism by which calls to methods can be included or omitted depending on whether a symbol is defined. | Intermediate |
/// | @ref TutorialDoxygenDocumentationPage             | Shows how to document code by using Doxygen. | Intermediate |
/// | @ref TutorialThreadingPage                        | Demonstrates various thread activities such as creating and executing a thread, synchronizing threads, interacting between threads, using a thread pool, and using a mutex object. | Advanced |
